Tree Swallows are used as a model organism to study the effects of contaminants on bird populations in the area. We collected Tree Swallow nestlings to analyze the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), perfluorinated substances (PFAS), and chlorinated pesticides on their biology, and developed a system to integrate transcriptomic responses with contaminant concentrations."

Targeted analysis with gene arrays or bioindicators can still provide significant performance, supporting their use in environmental assessments when large-scale, in-situ samples are not available. This comparison supported using non-targeted global gene expression for monitoring and prioritizing contaminated sites in the Great Lakes region."
